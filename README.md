## Dotfiles
These are the dotfiles I use to configure my development environment. Included are bash aliases/functions, vim bundles, script utilities, Sublime Text configuration, and more!

On my Mac, my Sublime configuration files go in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages`

I host them here mostly to keep workstation transitions sane, although there are several aliases and utilities any developer may find useful.
