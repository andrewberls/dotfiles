## Dotfiles
The dotfiles I use for Sublime Text and bash are located [here](https://github.com/andrewberls/snippets/tree/master/dotfiles). On my Mac, my Sublime configuration files go in `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages`

I mostly host them here to keep workstation transitions sane, although there are several aliases and utilities any developer may find useful.
